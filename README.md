# Lior and Nave's 3D Animations Assignment 1 (Decimation)

In this git repository there are two branches:
* Master branch = decimation with quadratic error calculation.
* Naive branch = decimation with tutorial 703 shortest edge and midpoint.

### NAIVE BRANCH
***********************************
The assignment is coded in the folder [Assignment1](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/3DAnimation_AS1/tree/naive/tutorial/Assignment1)

We changed [BasicScene.cpp](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/3DAnimation_AS1/blob/naive/tutorial/Assignment1/BasicScene.cpp) to encorporate the tutorial with the [*createDecimatedMesh*](https://github.com/ThatGuyVanquish/3DAnimation_AS1/blob/c8802bd5fbb8c1829de00ce2b1218c4ecd582ebf/tutorial/Assignment1/BasicScene.cpp#L5) method.
